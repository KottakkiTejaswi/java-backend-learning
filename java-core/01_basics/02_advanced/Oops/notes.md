# OOP Basics – Java

## Core idea
Object-Oriented Programming models data and behavior together while protecting object integrity.

## Class vs Object
- Class is a blueprint
- Object is a real instance in memory
- Objects live on heap, references on stack

## Constructors
- Ensure objects start in a valid state
- Default constructor exists only if no constructor is defined

## this keyword
- Refers to current object instance
- Used to resolve naming conflicts
- Improves code clarity
