📘 Problem Statement: Learning-Oriented Task Management API

As a developer aiming to strengthen fundamentals in Java and Spring Boot, there is a need for a hands-on project that goes beyond tutorials and demonstrates practical understanding of real-world backend development concepts.

This project focuses on building a simple yet meaningful Task Management REST API as a vehicle for learning core backend principles, including API design, clean architecture, data modeling, and separation of concerns.

Rather than prioritizing feature richness, the goal is to implement a system that is well-structured, maintainable, and easy to reason about, reflecting how production-grade backend services are designed at a foundational level.

Through this project, the following capabilities are explored:

- Designing RESTful endpoints using Spring Boot

- Structuring applications using Controller → Service → Repository layers

- Using DTOs to separate API contracts from internal models

- Applying object-oriented design principles

- Understanding request/response handling and HTTP semantics



The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, serving as a concrete domain through which backend engineering fundamentals can be practiced and demonstrated.
