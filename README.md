# Java Backend Learning

This repository documents my learning journey into **Java and Spring Boot backend development**.

The focus here is on:
- understanding core Java fundamentals
- learning how Spring Boot works under the hood
- structuring backend code in a clean, maintainable way
- documenting engineering decisions and trade-offs


## Learning Philosophy

- focus on fundamentals before frameworks  
- prefer simple, readable solutions  
- document learnings, not just final code  
- refactor as understanding improves

This repository is a work in progress — and that’s intentional.
